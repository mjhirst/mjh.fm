June was, June was hectic. The lovely sort of hectic. Full of weddings including my own! I think I experiences the month as a blur, looking back, I finished my 10th our of learning to drive (and haven't gotten behind the wheel since!). Planned my wedding, attended my wedding and attended the wedding of one of my best school-friends.

Oh, and I met Sadiq Khan. He gave a toast at a afternoon-tea my mother-in-law threw for us. HRH Princess Badiya bint Hassan of Jordan was also there. My mother-in-law, Pinky, now the closes thing I have to a mother - a title she's rightly earned, runs a fantastic programme to showcase women in business. Rather than inviting the CFO of Coca-Cola Enterprises or the CEO of Aviva or the Lord-Lieutenant of Greater London to York (I'm not kidding) she threw a tea party for us at the Berkley Hotel in Mayfair. The most touching part was when my husband's colleagues gave speeches. A very intense day in its own right. I felt a little bit like Miranda Priestly with my partner's colleagues as my own personal Emily and Andy.

My friend's wedding was up in Lancaster. They're high-school sweethearts of about thirteen years tying the knot. The church service was gorgeous and the groom was absolutely beaming sunshine the whole time. He couldn't have been happier. The bride was in her element walking a group of bowtie-wearing alpaca across the lawn of the hotel.

Then. my wedding was the week after. I'm not quite ready to type that all up. But it was absolutely fantastic.

I feel like I'd experienced June. I'm not sure how much say I had in how the month went besides the three days of my own design. But it was followed by plenty of sleep and sloth to recover.

Professionally, work were forgiving and gave me the space I needed to manage all of this, to which I'm thankful. I'd elected to take on an epic of work and oversee the delivery of a new feature. On reflection, I grossly underestimated how much my personal life would creep into the delivery. Which I've hopefully learnt from and won't pick up something like that without some serious forecasting - I understand I usually volunteer to try and be helpful. It was a new way for the team to work and there were some hiccups delegating work. I had assumed the team, who have been there longer than I have, would have autonomously picked up units of work. My manager gave me a bit of coaching in the form of two books: The Manager's Path[1^] and The Staff Engineer's Path[2^].

I've chosen the former. While I'm about two rungs away from even contemplating leading others, this was a nice testbed to which I could learn. My key takeaway is that it took much longer to deliver than I thought. And I generally felt uncomfortable asking others to do work - which I perceived was my own.

The staff get-together this month was also great, just to see everyone not-in-the-office. Out of it, I'm going to start a coding club to teach some of my colleagues; What Engineering does isn't magic. After some reflection, my first hurdle is just getting Ruby set up.
